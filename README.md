# Fe_GSC
Code to model mantle melting beneath and oceanic spreading centre, simulate the fractionation of Fe-isotopes during mantle melting, and use a MCMC algorithm to estimate the proportion of pyroxenite derived melt

Code produced in MATLAB R2018b

This file contains 5 documents, three of these are matlab functions (dirichletRnd.m; MeltPX.m; MeltPXtraceDirichletFe.m), 1 is an example datafile (6Donly.xlsx), and the final file is the master script (MeltPXFinal.m)

Please do not change or alter dirichletRnd.m, MeltPX.m, or MeltPXtraceDirichletFe.m but make sure these are in the same folder as MeltPXFinal.m.

6Donly.xlsx is an example file, when running the code with this file please ensure that is is in the same folder as MeltPXFinal.m.
